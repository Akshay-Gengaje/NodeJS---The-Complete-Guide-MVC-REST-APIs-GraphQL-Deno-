#### Summary

This module introduces Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js. It addresses the need to simplify common tasks like handling incoming requests, routing, and dealing with middleware. Express.js allows developers to focus on their business logic rather than getting bogged down by low-level details.

#### Highlights

- 🚀 **Introduction to Node.js and its Limitations**

  - Node.js alone requires extensive code for basic tasks like handling incoming requests.
  - Developers should ideally focus on business logic rather than dealing with routine tasks.

- 🔄 **Introduction to Express.js as a Solution**

  - Express.js is a third-party framework for Node.js that streamlines web development.
  - It outsources common tasks, providing a rule set and utility functions for cleaner code.

- 🤖 **Middleware Concept**
  - Middleware is a fundamental concept in Express.js.
  - It is a set of functions that have access to the request, response, and the next middleware function.
- 🌐 **Working with Requests and Responses**

  - Express.js simplifies working with requests and responses.
  - Developers can handle these components more efficiently compared to using Node.js alone.

- 🛤️ **Routing in Express.js**

  - Express.js enables the execution of different code for various paths or URLs without extensive if statements.
  - This streamlines the process of routing in web applications.

- 📄 **Returning HTML Pages with Express.js**
  - Express.js allows for the efficient return of HTML pages to clients.
  - This contrasts with the less optimal practice of writing HTML code directly in Node.js.
