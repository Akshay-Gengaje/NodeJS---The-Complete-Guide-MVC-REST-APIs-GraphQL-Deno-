#### Summary

This lecture focuses on sending responses in Node.js after handling requests. It covers setting headers, defining content types, and writing HTML code to the response. The instructor emphasizes the need to quit and restart the server after making edits for changes to take effect. The process involves using the response object to set headers and write data, followed by ending the response to signal completion.

#### Highlights

- 🌐 **HTTP Methods Overview:**
  - The lecture introduces various HTTP methods, emphasizing that the GET method is the default when entering a URL in a browser.
- 🔄 **Server Restart Requirement:**
  - To apply changes, it is crucial to quit and restart the server since edits won't reflect while the old process is still running.
- 📝 **Setting Headers:**
  - Demonstrates using the `setHeader` method to define headers, exemplified by setting the `content-type` header to `text/html`.
- 🧩 **Supported Headers and Future Learning:**
  - Mentions a limited set of supported headers and hints at a future lecture or link for additional information on headers.
- ✉️ **Writing to Response:**
  - Explains using `res.write` to add data, particularly HTML code, to the response. Describes it as working in chunks or multiple lines.
- 🛑 **Ending the Response:**
  - Highlights the importance of calling `res.end` after setting headers and writing data, signaling the completion of the response.
- 🔄 **No Further Writing After Ending:**
  - Emphasizes that attempting to write after ending the response will result in an error, as the response is in the process of being sent back to the client.
- 🧑‍💻 **Practical Demonstration:**
  - The instructor demonstrates creating an HTML document with a complex structure, including headers and body content.
- 📄 **Browser Interaction:**
  - Shows how the browser interprets the response by inspecting headers and the response body in the Chrome Developer Tools.
- 🚀 **Future Simplicity with ExpressJS:**
  - Mentions that while ExpressJS simplifies this process, understanding the underlying details is crucial.

This lecture provides a comprehensive guide to handling responses in Node.js, combining theoretical explanations with practical demonstrations.
