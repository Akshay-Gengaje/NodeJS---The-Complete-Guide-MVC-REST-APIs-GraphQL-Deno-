#### Summary
In this instructional session, the focus is on guiding users through the process of setting up a Node.js server using Visual Studio Code. The tutorial begins with the creation of an empty project folder in the IDE, including a gitignore file for version control, though the latter is optional. The root file for the Node.js application, often named `server.js` or `app.js`, is then created. The core module, specifically the `http` module, is highlighted for server creation.

#### Highlights
- üìÇ **Empty Folder Setup:**
  - Emphasizes starting with an empty project folder in Visual Studio Code.
  - Recommends using version management with Git, illustrated by the inclusion of a gitignore file.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Creating the Root File:**
  - Demonstrates the creation of a new file to serve as the root file for the Node.js application.
  - Suggests commonly used names for the root file, such as `server.js` or `app.js`.

- üì¶ **Importing Core Modules:**
  - Introduces core modules in Node.js, including `fs`, `path`, `os`, `http`, and `https`.
  - Focuses on the `http` module for handling HTTP requests and responses.

- üß© **Importing `http` Module:**
  - Explains the process of importing the `http` module using the `require` keyword.
  - Creates a constant named `http` to represent the imported module.

- üåê **Understanding Server Creation:**
  - Clarifies the need for importing modules to avoid global namespace pollution.
  - Introduces the `createServer` method provided by the `http` module for the creation of an HTTP server.

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Creating a Request Listener:**
  - Defines the concept of a request listener, a function executed for each incoming request.
  - Discusses three methods for defining the listener function: named function, anonymous function, and arrow function.

- üöÄ **Starting the Server:**
  - Demonstrates the use of the `listen` method to initiate the server.
  - Points out that the server remains active, preventing the script from immediately exiting and allowing it to handle incoming requests.

- üñ•Ô∏è **Testing the Server:**
  - Encourages users to execute the script and test the server by accessing `localhost:3000` in a web browser.
  - Notes that the server logs incoming requests to the console for verification.

- üîç **Ongoing Exploration:**
  - Acknowledges that future lectures will provide an in-depth analysis of the request object and guide users on effective response handling.

This tutorial serves as a comprehensive introduction to creating a fundamental Node.js server using the `http` module, laying the groundwork for more advanced server-side development.
